1.Explain how to avoid starvation in your implementation.
We avoid starvation in the implementation by calling back to the 
cats and mice queues to check for stragglers, then opening everything 
up when we finish both queues.

2.Comment on your experience of implementing the Cats-and-Mice program. 
Can you derive any principles about the use of the semaphore 
synchronization primitives?
This project showed the implementation of the wait and signal and 
showing how one thread can stop and sleep while a main body of code runs.
